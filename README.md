## 👋 About Me
I am a Master’s student in Experimental and Empirical Economics, currently completing my thesis, with an expected graduation in June. I have strong analytical skills and hands-on experience using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI** for data analysis and reporting. I work with real-world datasets to analyze trends, build dashboards, and translate data into clear insights that support business and operational decision-making. I am seeking **Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or Cost Analyst roles** where I can apply my analytical background and contribute measurable value.
